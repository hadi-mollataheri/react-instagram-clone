## Explanation

This is a _similar app to the instagram_ that I built with **ReactJS**.

**Topics:** React state, react-router-dom and CSS styles.

**Notice:** This repository and web app is only for the demonstration of some my coding abilities, practicing and also learning and not for marketing and other business purposes.

I embarked on this project as a series of practice exercises after dedicating a couple of years to learning front-end web development. My goal was twofold: to enhance my coding skills and bolster my resume, ultimately preparing myself for the job market.

Project number: 13
