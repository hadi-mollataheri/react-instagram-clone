## Overview

This project is an Instagram clone built with **ReactJS** (using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the development server) and is still under development. It showcases some of my coding abilities and serves as a personal learning tool rather than a commercial or marketing solution.

After dedicating several years to front-end web development, I embarked on this project as a series of practice exercises. My goal was to sharpen my skills and bolster my resume in preparation for the job market.

## Technologies & Topics

- **ReactJS:** Component architecture (JSX elements) and hooks (`useState`, `useRef`, `useEffect`)
- **Zustand:** Lightweight React state management
- **React Router DOM:** Client-side routing
- **Supabase:** Backend services and database management
- **Responsive Design**
- **Chakra UI**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **PostgreSQL:** Database schema design and table creation
- **Git:** Comprehensive version control utilizing commands like `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`, alongside branch management and conflict resolution techniques

## Features

  - Sign up and login with a Google account _(under development; available for developer testing)_
  - User registration with additional personal information

- **Database & Data Management**

  - Creation and management of tables for users, profiles, and posts
  - Handling data fetching and submission (e.g., post submission logic)
  - Managing asynchronous code execution for reliable state updates

- **User Interface & Experience**
